## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

In this directed study we will use a class balancing technique called Randomly OverSampling Examples (ROSE) and with a perfect R package for this task, called ROSE.

### 1.1 **Context:**
 
It is important that credit card companies can recognize fraudulent transactions exactly where they are designed, at the time, so customers aren't charged for items they haven't purchased.

In this project the objective was to identify a common problem when there are data with data that present cases (frauds, in this case).

## 2. BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS

The dataset contains transactions performed with credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, in which we have 492 frauds in 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) represents 0.172% of all the transactions. It contains only numeric input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Due to confidentiality issues, it is not can provide the original features and more background information about the data.

We will use the public dataset made available by the  [Machine Learning Group](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)


 ### 2.1 **Assumptions:** 
 
   * Features V1, V2,â€¦ V28 are the main components obtained with the PCA, the the only resources that have not been transformed with the PCA are 'Time' and 'Value';
   * The 'Hour' resource contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset;
   * The 'Amount' resource is the transaction amount;
   * O resource 'Class' is the response variable and takes the value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
